# Java Beans & Reflection

## Exercise 1 [Compulsory]

Create the non-visual Java bean `TempSensor` that implements a temperature sensor (if you use `NetBeans` create the bean in the project `TempSensor` and in the package `tempsensor`). The idea is that this bean periodically, for example every second, reads the current temperature and makes it available as the property `currentTemp` of type `float`. The class `TempSensor` must have also the method `void go()` that starts the sensing. To implement the sensing use the class Timer to periodically generate a random `float` value in the range `[-20,50]` through the class [Random](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) and assign it to the property `currentTemp`. Note that every time the value of `currentTemp` changes `TempSensor` must notify that event through a `PropertyChangeEvent`. Export the bean `TempSensor` _Exercise 1_ in the `jar` file `TempSensor.jar`. **Solution format**: Source java file `TempSensor.java`, adequately commented, and jar file `TempSensor.jar`.

## Exercise 2 [Compulsory]

Import the bean `TempSensor` of _Exercise 1_ from the jar file inside the palette of `NetBeans`. Create the project `TempViewer` and the class `TempFrame` that extends a `JFrame`. Add to this frame a `JLabel`, a `JButton` and the `TempSensor`. The idea is that when the user clicks on the button the `TempSensor` starts the sensing and the label shows the values periodically generated by `TempSensor`. To do that, link the property `currentTemp` of `TempSensor` with the property `text` of `JLabel`. Export the project in the jar file `TempViewer.jar`. **Solution format**: Source java files, adequately commented, and jar file `TempViewer.jar`.

## Exercise 3 [Optional]

Create a Java bean `TempSensorVetoable` which extends the bean `TempSensor` of the _Exercise 1_ by making the property `currentTemp` **constrained**, i.e., by allowing objects that register as `vetoableChangeListener` to block the modification of the property. In order to test the modified bean, modify (a copy of) the `TempViewer` project by adding a `JToggleButton`. Only when this button is pressed, the changes to the property `currentTemp` of `TempSensorVetoable` are constrained to be in the range `[0,30]`. **Solution format**: Source java files, adequately commented, and jar file of the project.

## Exercise 4 [Compulsory]
Write the Java program `ExecTest` that takes as arguments the names of other Java classes. For each class name, `ExecTest` loads the corresponding class, say it `C`, by using the reflection API. After loading `C`, `ExecTest` must create a new instance `t` of `C`, must search and invoke on `t` all the non `private` methods with no arguments whose name starts with `test`. Test your program using the provided class `ClassWithTest` either setting the `Arguments` field in the `Project Properties` configuration window of `NetBeans` or running in a shell the command

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">java ExecTest ClassWithTest
</pre>
</div>

The expected output should be

<pre class="example">Tests ready to run
Invocation of testAbs
abs(-2) = 2: ok
abs(-3) = -2: no
Invocation of testRound
round(0.7) = 1: ok
round(0.2) = 1: no
Invocation of testMin
min(7,3) = 3: ok
min(5,7) = 7: no
Invocation of testMax
max(7,14) = 14: ok
max(5,7) = 5: no
</pre>

**Solution format**: Source java files, adequately commented.

## Exercise 5 [Optional]

Write the Java program `CheckNPE` that takes as arguments the names of other Java classes. For each method or constructor declared in `C` which has at least one parameter of a reference type, `CheckNPE` checks if it is _NPE sensible_, that is, if invoking the constructor or method with _default parameter values_ a `NullPointerException` is thrown. The default value of a numeric primitive type parameter is `0`, of a `boolean` parameter il `false`, ot a reference type parameter is `null`. For each class name passed as parameter, `CheckNPE` must print for each declared constructor or method 1\. the name 2\. the list of parameter types 3\. if it is _NPE sensible_ or not, when it has at least one parameter of a reference type. **Solution format**: Source java files, adequately commented.
